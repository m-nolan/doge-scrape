The audits will use Inter-rater reliability reviews of Beneficiary Appeals and Short Stay claims to assess the validity and accuracy of the BFCC-QIOs reviews. The AIRR contractor will also systematically screen medical records for adverse patient safety events that occurred in hospitals and other settings using a standardized process and review each medical record that is positive for an adverse patient safety event to determine “the completeness, adequacy and quality of the care provided.”""",TERMINATED,https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7530&PIID=75FCMC24F0155&modNumber=P00002&idvAgencyID=&idvPIID=GS10F096CA&contractType=AWARD,2/24/2025,11170140,7530,75FCMC24F0155,P00002,4732,GS10F096CA,PA0045,02/27/2025,09/18/2024,02/27/2025,09/17/2029,01/24/2024,0.0,2792535.0,0.0,2792535.0,0.0,13962675.0,HDMEVXGXC1D4,"AVAR CONSULTING, INC.",,4KTA7,297 HERNDON PKWY STE 103B,,HERNDON,VA,201704466,USA,UNITED STATES,(301) 588-4000,(301) 977-0331,VIRGINIA 11,R408,SUPPORT- PROFESSIONAL: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT/SUPPORT,541611.0,ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTING SERVICES,MD,,USA,MONTGOMERY,ROCKVILLE,,20850,2452.0,,2025-04-04-0017
